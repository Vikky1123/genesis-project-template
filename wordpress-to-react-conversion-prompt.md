# WordPress to React Component Conversion Prompt

## Task Description
I need to convert the following WordPress HTML section to a React component. Please maintain exact styling, class names, and DOM structure while ensuring images load correctly.

## Section Details
[PASTE THE HTML/CSS HERE OR DESCRIBE THE SECTION]

## Important Requirements
1. **Preserve exact styling and classes** - Don't change any class names or styling
2. **Maintain image paths correctly** - Use relative paths that work with my existing structure
3. **Convert to functional React components** - Use modern React patterns
4. **Handle animations** - If the section uses animations (like AOS), include them properly
5. **Fix any HTML-to-JSX syntax** - Convert attributes like class→className, for→htmlFor, etc.

## Current Project Structure
- The public folder contains asset files at: `/public/assets/img/uploads/2023/10/` 
- CSS files are imported in the main App component
- Components are organized in the src/components directory by section

## Example of Success
The HeroBanner component conversion worked well because:
1. All original CSS classes were preserved
2. Image paths were correctly mapped to the public directory
3. JSX syntax was properly implemented
4. Animation attributes were maintained
5. DOM structure hierarchy matched the original

Please provide the complete React component with all necessary imports and proper JSX syntax.
